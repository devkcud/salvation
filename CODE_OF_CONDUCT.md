# 💯 Code of Conduct for the Needy

> Nobody reads this, so I will write it as if it was for my team.

## 📜 Guiding Principles

We are bound together by one unifying belief: that `nil` should be secured, contained, and protected. To that end:

- Be respectful. Or at least constructively indifferent.
- Argue ideas, not people. You shall insult a commit, not a contributor.
- Don't make this weird, political, or hateful.
- Keep discussions focused, fun, and one existential crisis at a time.

## 🚫 Absolutely Not

- Harassment, bigotry, gatekeeping, unsolicited enterprise architecture diagrams.
- Making contributors feel bad unless their PR breaks the build and the commit is titled `"chore: fix later maybe idk"`.
- Using `interface{}`. Just use `any`. We are not running `go 1.18`.
- Mock the usage of `reflect`.

## ⚖️ Enforcement

Violations will be met with a firm but awkward conversation, followed by a redirect to the local authorities (Lord in Heaven, or whatever you believe in). Just be chill.
